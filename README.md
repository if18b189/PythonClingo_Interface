<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The purpose of this project ist to bridge the gap between two technologies. Answer Set Programming(ASP) is gaining 
traction in science and industries around the world. ASP provides an alternative approach to certain computational 
problems. Due to advancements in hardware our computers are able to utilize this technology. Unfortunately most 
of them are not that easy to set up and require know-how.

Clingo by Poassco ("Potsdam Answer Set Solving Collection") is the union of gringo(grounder) and clasp(solver).
This project focuses on interfacing Python with Clingo, mostly Jupyter Notebooks to be precise.

By downloading and running our project you can get a quick introduction to Clingo by following a step-by-step
Jupyter Notebook tutorial. You will also have the tools at hand to execute Clingo code and using the results 
in Python/JupyterNotebooks.


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* Python and Jupyter Notebook
* Clingo installation
  * Anaconda ```conda install -c potassco clingo```
  * or download & install [Clingo](https://potassco.org/clingo/) manually 
    * (it may be necessary to add the extracted folder to your OS path / environment variables )
  
### Installation

Tested with Python `3.8.8` other versions may or may not work.
```
git clone https://github.com/if18b189/PythonClingo_Interface.git
cd PythonClingo_Interface
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
